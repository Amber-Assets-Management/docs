# What is a decentralized hedge fund? 

Decentralized hedge fund - is a smart contract which is implemented in a special way to provide the following abilities:

 * Asset management strategy isolation. Smart contract is only allowed to interact with a specific list of other smart contracts. For instance, an asset manager can swap bitcoin to usdc (crypto usd) but cant buy something else in exchange of bitcoin.
 * Asset isolation. Smart contract design allows the execution of special trading\management strategies but asset managers are prohibited to withdraw any assets that were invested by others. 
 * Transparency. Smart contract provides full transparency about how strategies are performing, together with information about how theyâ€™re set up, operated and composed.
 * Asset control. Smart contract allow you to withdraw or add more liquidity anytime. 
 * Investment Control. Smart contract allows to assets managers to decide with whom they want to cooperate and keep all investments healthy and safe.
