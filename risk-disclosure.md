# Risk disclosure

## Platforms & protocols risk assessment framework

For platforms & protocols, risk assessment Amber Asset Management uses quite a similar approach as for **assets risk assessment**.

### Risk Scale
The risk scale ranges from the lowest risk A+ for the safest of the protocol (Ethereum) to the highest risk D-.

#### Technology risk
Estimation based on platform or protocol codebase assessment. 

#### Counter-party risk
Estimation is based on knowledge of how is platform or protocol centralized and what approaches it uses for decision making.

#### Liquidity & Market risk
Estimation based on TVL of the protocol or platform.

Requirements for platforms & protocols risk level to be able to use them within Amber Asset Management funds:
 - Smart Contract risk level: **B+**
 - Counterparty Risk level: **C**
 - Market risk level: **B**

## Assets risk assessment framework

Amber Asset Management utilizes the [AAVE Risk Framework metodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) for risk assessment for currencies allocated in all funds.  
Requirements for asset risk level to be able to use them within Amber Asset Management funds:
 - Smart Contract risk level: **B+**
 - Counterparty Risk level: **C**
 - Market risk level: **B+**
