# A few words about crypto

 > The motivation for running hedge funds in the crypto space lays out in a unique fusion of opportunities, convenience and security that cryptocurrencies provide. Before we dive into fund specification it’s worth mentioning what crypto is and why Ethereum plays an essential role here.

## What is crypto?

A cryptocurrency is a cryptographically secured, permissionless, censorship-resistant digital form of cash. Compared to classical centralized digital payment systems like PayPal crypto has the following advantages:
 * No one can stop you from using cryptocurrency. Centralized payment services (banks, e-money), on the other hand, can freeze accounts or prevent transactions from being made.
 * Because of the way the network is designed, it's virtually impossible for hackers or other attackers to shut it down. 
 * You can make transactions anytime and everywhere. Your money can be sent within seconds – at a fraction of the cost of an international wire transfer.

## What is Ethereum

There are two most secured and time-verified cryptocurrencies: [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). While Bitcoin is the most secure and robust crypto, it's perfectly designed only for transactions and as a value storage. Ethereum went feather and named itself a decentralized computing platform.

In Ethereum, everyone can create special programs called [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/). When a user or other smart contract sends a transaction to another smart contract, every node on the Ethereum network runs the contract’s code and records the output into the blockchain. It looks like a virtual user inserts a coin into a “vending machine” which runs on millions of computers at the same time and gives something back to the user. 
This leads us to the following advantages:
 * Anyone, anywhere, can launch applications that can’t be taken offline once it is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain even by a developer who created it. 
 * Users or other smart contracts can interact with smart contracts from anywhere. Only smart contract code decides who and how to interact with it. There are no external rules and policies. 
 * Users can be sure that the logic of smart contracts will not change. If developers create an update for their smart contract - they have to deploy a new one, while the old one still works well and will work until the Ethereum blockchain exists.
