# How do hedge funds operate on the dHedge platform?

 * [dHedge](https://www.dhedge.org/) platform  allows investors to mirror the strategy of top investment managers and traders. This is done in a way where investment managers are not able to withdraw investor funds thanks to dHEDGE's smart contracts.
 * Investors retain custody of their funds while invested. When an investor buys a stake in a trader's pool, the investor is issued a pool token, representing their share in the pool.
 * An investor is able to redeem funds from the smart contracts using their pool tokens when they withdraw. Only the pool token holder has access to the funds in the smart contract associated with that user's share.
 * Asset Managers earn performance fees calculated based on [height-watermark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/highwatermark.asp).

For a more detailed overview of the platform, please read carefully [dHedge docs](https://docs.dhedge.org/dhedge-protocol)
